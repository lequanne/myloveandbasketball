# myloveandbasketball
This is the first website I built by using a css template and javascript plugin. I sourced the images using Google, got them vectorized and used GIMP to alter the text, white space, etc. The aim was to create a fun picture frame single page web app for Black History Month displaying black love in it's many forms--Paris is Burning for queer love, The Wood for brotherly love, Set It Off for sisterly love, and Love and Basketball for coupled love--as all the frames are of classic Black films. Designed and coded for the month of February 2016. 

Original website was myloveandbasketball.com. An interactive version of this web app available <a href="http://www.frontdev.ro/lvb">here</a>.
