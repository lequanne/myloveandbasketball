This is the first website I built by using a css template and javascript plugin. I sourced the images using Google, got them vectorized and used GIMP to alter the text, white space, etc. The aim was to create a fun picture frame single page web app for Black History Month displaying black love in it's many forms--queer, brotherly, sisterly, coupled--as all the frames are of classic Black films.
